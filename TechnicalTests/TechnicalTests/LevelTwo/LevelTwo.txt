In level two, your task is to create a calculator that can handle the reverse polish notation.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation

Your code should accept a string of all the operations in reverse polish notation, and return the result of these operations.

Valid operators are + - * /

All operators and operands will be separated by a space.

You don't need to handle any error case (such as more than 1 result in the end, or stack overflow or division by 0 ...)

Have a look at the unit tests to see examples.
